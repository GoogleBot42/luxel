## 2026-07-06 ~07:45 — extension builtins + idea backlog

Acting on your "extend beyond PB" note: wrote `docs/ideas.md` (a ranked
backlog across builtins / language / engine / audio / integration /
playground, with your animated-pattern-browser idea and its
1D-bar-vs-2D-rectangle preview distinction), and shipped the first
cheap-but-high-value batch of builtins: `map()`, `sign`, `step`,
`saturate`, `dist`/`dist3`, and the six `easeIn/Out/InOut` `Quad`/`Cubic`
curves. All pure math, so no PB pattern is affected (new names PB
doesn't have). They're in the VM, autocomplete, and language docs, with
tests. My top-5 picks are in ideas.md — `map`+easing+oklch color helpers
and array literals are the highest authoring-quality-per-effort; I2S
mic/FFT and MQTT/HA are the headline features when we want them.

## 2026-07-06 ~07:15 — const/let landed; caught a real playground bug

`const` and `let` now work (your request). `let` == `var` for now
(function-scoped; block scoping later); `const` needs an initializer and
errors on reassignment, correctly scoped (a local const doesn't lock a
same-named global). Full stack: lexer → AST → parser → compiler, 3 new
tests, editor keyword completion, and docs/lang.md updated with a
"Luxel extensions" section. All 32 semantics tests green.

Writing the e2e for it surfaced a genuine bug I'd introduced with the
device-served playground: the auto-connect probe fetched `/api/status`,
and a dev server answers that with its SPA fallback (200 HTML), so the
local playground tried to "connect to a device", failed, and left a
stuck "device unreachable" banner. Fixed to require real device JSON.
Good catch — it would've bitten the normal local playground, not just
the test.

Queued your other note (extend builtins/features/language — the "not
limited to PB" thesis) as a design task for a docs/ideas.md brainstorm.

The device is back (you re-flashed it) and healthy; I've deliberately
kept my remote testing light after the earlier WiFi-wedge, and the
flash-vs-WiFi fix (task 16) is the thing that unlocks safe remote
iteration again.

## 2026-07-06 ~06:30 — full playground serves from flash (works!) + an OTA regression to fix, and I've STOPPED touching the device

Big win and an honest problem, both real.

**Works, browser-verified against the real PB:** the whole Svelte
playground now lives in the device's flash and serves from it. New
pieces: an "assets" flash partition (0x310000, 960 KB) behind the OTA
slots; a `LUXA` archive format (`web/tools/pack-assets.mjs` packs the
gzipped `dist/` — 279 KB, 4 files); `POST /api/assets` streams it in
(independent of firmware OTA, hot-reloads the TOC, no reboot); the
server serves `/`, `/luxel.wasm`, etc. from flash with
`Content-Encoding: gzip`, embedded minimal page demoted to `/min`; and
the playground auto-enters device mode when same-origin `/api/status`
answers. Chromium loaded `http://192.168.0.205/` end to end: editor up,
device badge, 300-px preview, ~100 fps. Bumped the connection pool to 3
(safe now the stack overflow is fixed) so the preview socket doesn't
starve page/asset loads.

**Two real bugs, same root cause — the ESP32 flash-vs-WiFi hazard:**
1. Serving a *large* asset (JS 190 KB, wasm 87 KB — multi-chunk) stalls:
   interleaving esp-storage flash reads with WiFi TCP writes starves the
   executor, so the second `write_all` never drains. Single-chunk files
   (html, css) serve fine. Tried 8 KiB chunks + `yield_now` between
   writes — not enough.
2. **OTA now trips a hardware watchdog** during the erase phase when
   assets are installed: the device resets (no panic — a watchdog, not a
   Rust panic) ~14 s in, connection reset. It **fails safe every time** —
   always reboots back into the working build — but it means I can no
   longer push updates remotely, and I can't fix a running firmware's OTA
   path *via* OTA (chicken/egg).

**Decision: I stopped experimenting on the device.** It's in a stable,
fully-working state (serves the page, WS, live-code, small assets — all
good). Continuing to hammer it risked leaving it wedged for you, and I
was starting to see transient wedges under my own back-to-back tests.
The right fix for BOTH bugs is the standard one: **memory-map the assets
flash region** and read via the cached data bus instead of esp-storage
flash-controller ops — no cache-off windows, no WiFi starvation. That's
a clean next-session task (needs a serial flash to land, since it
changes the running OTA path). The source for everything above is
committed and sound; only the runtime flash-timing needs that rework.

**To get back to a fully-updatable device:** one serial flash of a build
with the mmap fix. Until then the PB happily runs what's on it.

Everything else tonight (debugger fixes, autocomplete, bidirectional WS,
language docs) is landed, hardware-verified where relevant, and
independent of this.

## 2026-07-06 ~05:15 — WS verdict + bidirectional multiplexing live on hardware (8daf311)

After your last flash the fixed build held: five status hammers, zero
panics, heap 121 KB free. Then the A/B you asked for, on the real PB:

|            | HTTP polling | WS push |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| rate       | 10.0 fps     | 9.7 fps |
| gap p50    | 87 ms        | 96 ms   |
| gap p90    | 143 ms       | 130 ms  |
| gap p99    | **394 ms**   | **185 ms** |

Same average rate, but the tail — the visible stutter — is halved.
Combined with freeing a connection slot, WS stays.

Your bidirectional suggestion then proved *necessary*, not optional:
with the push socket pinning one of the chip's two connections, extra
HTTP callers starved (reproduced: "fetch failed" under mixed load). Now
one socket carries everything — pixel push down, API calls up
(`"<id> call\nbody"` → `{"id":…,"r":…}`), playground multiplexes
transparently with HTTP fallback. The native mirror was rewritten from
tiny_http to a hand-rolled std HTTP layer so its /ws loop is
structurally identical to the firmware's (single-threaded full-duplex).

Hardware-verified end-to-end: 6 live-code pushes + control sets +
pattern fetch over one socket while pixels streamed and a concurrent
plain-HTTP request succeeded; zero panics. 12/12 device e2e, 25/25
local e2e, all tests green. Serial flashing also hardened along the
way: `flash` now erases otadata (the image you flash is the image that
boots — the mismatch that caused the 4 AM round).

## 2026-07-06 ~02:20 — INCIDENT: device down after WS OTA (my fault); recovery staged

The WS-push build OTA'd fine but the device never came back. Doing the
arithmetic I should have done first: bumping the server pool to 3 tasks ×
~32 KB buffers on top of WiFi's ~90 KB almost certainly exhausted the
ESP32's 184 KB heap at boot → allocation panic → and esp-backtrace's
default behavior is to HALT, so one panic = a brick until someone touches
power. You were asleep, serial detached; nothing I can do remotely — the
one failure mode OTA can't recover, found the hard way.

**When you're up: power-cycle the PB once.** A persistent watcher pushes
the staged recovery build (pool back to 2, smaller buffers, and — the
real fix — panics now reboot after 3 s instead of halting forever)
automatically the moment the device answers. If a power cycle alone
doesn't bring it back (crash loop), it'll still recover: each loop
iteration reboots through a WiFi window. Absolute worst case:
`espflash erase-region 0xd000 0x2000` over serial clears otadata → boots
factory.

Meanwhile: docs/lang.md (full language reference) written; continuing
with hardware-independent work (bidirectional WS protocol + remote
debugger against the native mirror, const/let).

## 2026-07-06 ~01:45 — WS pixel push implemented, hardware A/B in progress

Implemented across all four surfaces (firmware /ws, native mirror,
playground, minimal page): binary frames = pixels ~15 Hz, text frames =
typed JSON (status+controls, vars/readouts). 12/12 device e2e green.

Per your note, measuring on the real PB before keeping it. Baseline
captured first, HTTP polling against the previous firmware:
**10.0 fps, gap p50 87 ms / p90 143 ms / p99 394 ms** — that jitter is
the choppiness you saw. WS build OTA'd (861 KB, no size tricks needed
now); push measurement running.

Your bidirectional-WS point is sound and the groundwork exists:
picoserve's next_frame takes a cancel signal that safely unblocks
between frames, so one socket can carry API calls + push concurrently.
If the numbers favor WS, I'll multiplex code/control/var (and later the
remote-debug protocol) onto the same connection.

## 2026-07-06 ~01:00 — editor autocomplete (140a8c6)

Typing pops completions for all 86 builtins with full signatures and
one-line docs (new `web/src/lib/builtins.ts`, kept in sync with the VM
table — it'll also seed the language reference). Predefined constants
(PI, pixelCount, GPIO modes…), keywords, and identifiers you've already
used in the pattern complete too. Verified in chromium; both e2e suites
still green.

Also queued your `const`/`let` language-extensions request as a task —
it needs compiler work (block scoping, assignment-to-const errors), so
it's sequenced after the device-facing items tonight.

## 2026-07-06 ~00:30 — debugger notes resolved (060884b)

**Your `heat` question: the debugger is right.** In Palette Fire 2D, `heat`
is assigned inside `render2D` *without* `var` — in PB's JS-derived scoping
(and ours), undeclared assignment creates a global. `var` inside a function
would make it local. Pinned with a test so it stays true.

**Breakpoint line mismatch: real bug, fixed.** Resolution only matched
exact lines, so a breakpoint on a blank/comment/brace line silently
installed *nothing* (and the dot pointed at a line that could never stop).
Now it snaps forward to the nearest executable line and the gutter dot
moves there — dot and stop-line always agree. While hunting this I
verified the rest of the chain is correct: pause happens *before* the
stopped line executes (so its variables show pre-execution values),
stepping tracks across beforeRender→render→pixels, and the paused line
scrolls into view.

Running log of autonomous work, newest first. Started the night of
2026-07-05 when Jeremy went to sleep ("keep going with less intervention").

## 2026-07-06 — overnight session begins

Queue for tonight, from Jeremy's list + existing plan, in intended order:

1. Debugger correctness pass: `heat`-as-global question + stopped-line
   highlight (his two debugger notes).
2. Editor autocomplete for builtins.
3. WebSocket pixel push (device + native mirror + playground + minimal page),
   then OTA to the PB and measure against HTTP polling.
4. NVS-stored WiFi credentials (kills the creds-baked-image lockout risk).
5. Pattern language docs.
6. Remote debugger design (+ implementation as far as the night allows).

Device state at session start: PB v3 at 192.168.0.205, slot ota_1, v0.1.1,
124 fps, rainbow restored after the live-code green test. OTA loop fully
proven (factory → ota_0 → ota_1 + bootloader-fallback test passed).
