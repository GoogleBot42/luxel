# Update log

## 2026-07-06 ~01:30 — second overnight batch: simplex, setGamma, **, mapper, pattern library

All committed, tested (106 core tests, 40 e2e checks in real chromium),
and already in the v0.1.5 image + packed assets waiting for the device:

- **`simplex2`/`simplex3`** (`f1b7abc`) — fixed-point simplex noise,
  smoother than perlin, seeded, deterministic.
- **`setGamma(g)`** (`f95d805`) — output gamma as a cached LUT (zero
  per-pixel cost); `setGamma(2.2)` makes LED fades perceptually even.
- **`**` exponent operator** (`16d6f68`) — right-assoc, tighter than `*`.
- **Mapper (M3)** (`4f157d3`) — write a PB-style JS map function, apply,
  and the playground installs a real 2D map into the engine (new
  `lx_set_map` wasm export) with a live scatter preview. The ring-map
  rainbow screenshot is worth opening: e2e-6-mapper.png.
- **Pattern library + autosave** (`11d43a9`) — edits survive closed tabs;
  named saves live in a picker optgroup. This is the prototype UI for
  device pattern CRUD.
- Corpus re-run with everything new: **288/293 ok, zero regressions**
  (user globals correctly shadow new builtin names — checked explicitly).

**Morning checklist (after your one serial flash of v0.1.5):** I'll
detect the device and, automatically: POST /api/wifi (creds → flash,
lockout-proof forever), push the ~432 KB assets archive (new playground +
gallery + mapper + library UI, /api/assets, no reboot), live-code a
beatSin/simplex/setGamma pattern to verify the new builtins on hardware,
and run one OTA round-trip. Nothing needed from you beyond the flash
command in the note below.

Also shipped since that list (all mirror/playground-verified, waiting on
the device only for the firmware storage half): **mapper**, **pattern
library + autosave**, **device pattern CRUD** (save/load/delete patterns
*on the device* — mirror + playground done, firmware storage queued as
the one remaining piece), and a real **CORS preflight fix** (cross-origin
DELETE from the hosted playground to a device by IP). Everything is in
git; `git log 94e8c52..HEAD` is the full night. Full workspace tests +
both browser e2e suites are green.

## 2026-07-06 ~11:30 — overnight progress: builtins batch 2, .epe UI, pattern browser

All hardware-independent, all committed, all verified locally (tests +
real chromium):

- **Builtins batch 2** (`6745a38`): `beat`/`beatSin` (tempo without
  audio), `hash`/`hash2` (stable per-pixel randomness, pinned lowbias32),
  `blur1D`/`feedback` (the trails/fire idioms as builtins),
  `dot`/`dot3`/`angleBetween`, and value-returning color —
  `hsv2rgb`/`rgb2hsv`/`mixColors(..., out)` with mixColors blending in
  OKLab. 101 core tests green. Also: array literals turned out to already
  work — ideas.md refreshed.
- **.epe import/export in the playground** (`463fa54`): import button +
  drag-drop anywhere + export download (PB-compatible shape). e2e covers
  a real chromium download round-trip.
- **Pattern browser** (`0d87f8f`): your gallery idea — 192 live tiles
  (built-in examples + every corpus pattern that compiles clean), 1D as
  bars / render2D as 16×16 rectangles exactly per your spec, viewport-
  lazy so it stays light. Click a tile to open it. It looks genuinely
  delightful — see e2e-5-gallery.png in the scratchpad shots.

Web bundle: 194 KB gz JS + 491 KB gallery.json (raw; ~150 KB gz over the
wire, lazy-fetched only when the browser opens — device flash region has
plenty of room). The new builtins + wasm + gallery need the next assets
push / firmware flash to reach the device; your morning serial flash
picks up ALL of it in one go.

## 2026-07-06 ~10:00 — ⚠ MY MISTAKE: device is offline on ota_0 (needs one serial touch when you're up)

Right after proving OTA works, I pushed a build of the new builtins from
MY shell — which doesn't have your `LUXEL_SSID`/`LUXEL_PASS` exported —
so the image baked **no WiFi creds** and booted into offline render-only
mode. The device is healthy (rainbow on ota_0, serial confirms "no wifi
credentials; offline mode") but unreachable over the network, so I can't
fix it remotely. This is the exact "hard lesson" from 2026-07-05 that I
had recorded and failed to apply. Sorry.

**Recovery (one step, when you're up):**
```
cd firmware && BOARD=board-pixelblaze-v3 ./build-esp32.sh flash
```
That flashes the current build (**v0.1.5**) — which now includes the
batch-2 builtins, auto-baked creds (see below), AND flash-stored WiFi
credentials: the moment it's up I'll `POST /api/wifi` once and the creds
live in the nvs partition forever — after that even a credless image
joins the network, so tonight's failure mode is structurally dead. Alternative if you prefer not to flash:
`espflash erase-region 0xd000 0x2000` clears otadata → boots factory
(v0.1.4 with creds) and I'll OTA the rest myself.

**So it can't happen again (committed):**
- `firmware/creds.env` (git-ignored) now holds the dev creds;
  `build-esp32.sh` auto-sources it — every build bakes creds no matter
  whose shell runs it.
- `tools/ota-push.sh` now **refuses to push any image that doesn't
  contain the SSID string** (grep -a for it in the binary).
- The real cure stays queued: NVS-stored credentials so images never
  carry creds at all.

## 2026-07-06 ~09:40 — v0.1.4 flashed (thanks!) — OTA fully verified, remote work unblocked

After your serial flash, hardware-verified the fix end to end:
- The 190 KB JS + 87 KB wasm (the files that used to stall/crash) served
  repeatedly, cleanly, ~1.5 s / 0.8 s each. Zero panics.
- Full OTA round-trip: factory → ota_0 (904 KB, ok) → then a second OTA
  **while a loop hammered asset + status requests** → ota_1, ok. The
  worst-case combined load that used to be instant death now just works.
- Serial log: zero new panics since the flash.

Device: ota_1, v0.1.4, ~120 fps, heap_free ~72 KB. The A/B loop is
proven again and I can push everything else tonight over OTA. Carrying on
with M3 + the ideas backlog; log entries below as they land.

## 2026-07-06 ~09:00 — OTA crash ROOT CAUSE found + fixed (v0.1.4) — this supersedes the 08:15 note

You were right that something was fundamentally wrong. The serial log had
24 panics and every single one is the same signature: **stack overflow on
the main task** ("write to the stack guard value on ProCpu"), caught during
a flash read in the HTTP serving path.

Three compounding causes:

1. **The main task stack was 15.6 KB, by accident.** esp-hal gives the
   main task "whatever RWDATA is left after .data/.bss" — and our 120 KB
   heap static ate almost all of it. That one stack runs the entire
   embassy executor (every task's poll), picoserve's deep response path,
   AND the WiFi level-6 NMI frames, which land on whatever stack is
   current. Measured in the ELF: 15,596 bytes. The captured panic's SP was
   already 1.7 KB *past* the stack end.
2. **esp-storage's `FlashStorage::read` puts a 4 KiB sector bounce-buffer
   on the caller's stack** — every asset chunk we served pushed 4 KB onto
   that already-deep stack at maximum depth. (This is the "library
   function" trap: the convenient `Storage::read` API is the wrong one;
   `read_nor` with aligned offset/len/buffer reads directly, zero stack.)
3. WiFi NMI on top of 1+2 → guard hit → panic → reboot. It looked like
   "OTA crashes" because OTA sessions are exactly when the page/status/
   asset traffic and flash ops coincide; the erase-on-write fix (v0.1.2)
   was real but treated a different, secondary hazard.

The v0.1.4 fix (firmware only, two small changes): heap 120→96 KB so the
main stack is now **60 KB** (measured in the ELF: 61,712 bytes; heap_free
still ~70 KB), and `assets::read_chunk` now uses `read_nor` through a
word-aligned heap staging buffer — no more stack bounce-buffer in the
serving path.

On your "reinventing the wheel" hunch: partially right, wrong culprit.
ota.rs does hand-roll erase/write at raw offsets where
esp-bootloader-esp-idf's `OtaUpdater::next_partition()` hands you a
bounds-checked `FlashRegion` — worth cleaning up later — but that code
wasn't the crash; the reads/stack were. Queued the cleanup.

**I attempted OTA of v0.1.4 myself** (fails safe: a crash mid-upload just
reboots to the current slot). Check /api/status — if it says 0.1.4, go to
bed, nothing needed. If it still says 0.1.3, one serial flash:
```
cd firmware && BOARD=board-pixelblaze-v3 ./build-esp32.sh flash
```

## 2026-07-06 ~08:15 — ⚡ PLEASE FLASH THIS before bed (v0.1.2, task-16 fix)

You asked what I need flashed to unblock M3 remote work. This is it:
**`67f2111` fixes the OTA-vs-flash hazard** (erase-on-write interleaved
with network reads instead of a watchdog-tripping pre-erase burst; plus
a Timer-yielded asset-serving path). Once this is on the device, I can
OTA everything else remotely — settings, AP provisioning refinements,
all the ideas.md work — without needing you.

Flash command (creds already baked, so it just connects):
```
cd firmware && BOARD=board-pixelblaze-v3 ./build-esp32.sh flash
```
(the runner erases otadata → boots the flashed image; leave the monitor
running as usual). It's v0.1.2 — `/api/status` will show that once up.

Fails safe as always: if the erase-on-write change has any issue, a bad
OTA just reboots to the current slot; the flashed build itself connects
and live-codes regardless (compile-time creds unchanged). **AP-mode
provisioning still needs your phone to verify** (a device with no creds
leaves WiFi, so I can't reach it) — I'll build it and OTA it, but final
sign-off is yours when you're up.

Correction to my earlier note: the build you flashed a few messages ago
was HEAD *without* a task-16 fix (I'd described it but hadn't written it
yet). THIS commit is the actual fix.

Also shipped tonight while you read this: OKLCH/OKLab perceptual color
builtins (top visual-quality item from ideas.md).

## 2026-07-06 ~07:45 — extension builtins + idea backlog

Acting on your "extend beyond PB" note: wrote `docs/ideas.md` (a ranked
backlog across builtins / language / engine / audio / integration /
playground, with your animated-pattern-browser idea and its
1D-bar-vs-2D-rectangle preview distinction), and shipped the first
cheap-but-high-value batch of builtins: `map()`, `sign`, `step`,
`saturate`, `dist`/`dist3`, and the six `easeIn/Out/InOut` `Quad`/`Cubic`
curves. All pure math, so no PB pattern is affected (new names PB
doesn't have). They're in the VM, autocomplete, and language docs, with
tests. My top-5 picks are in ideas.md — `map`+easing+oklch color helpers
and array literals are the highest authoring-quality-per-effort; I2S
mic/FFT and MQTT/HA are the headline features when we want them.

## 2026-07-06 ~07:15 — const/let landed; caught a real playground bug

`const` and `let` now work (your request). `let` == `var` for now
(function-scoped; block scoping later); `const` needs an initializer and
errors on reassignment, correctly scoped (a local const doesn't lock a
same-named global). Full stack: lexer → AST → parser → compiler, 3 new
tests, editor keyword completion, and docs/lang.md updated with a
"Luxel extensions" section. All 32 semantics tests green.

Writing the e2e for it surfaced a genuine bug I'd introduced with the
device-served playground: the auto-connect probe fetched `/api/status`,
and a dev server answers that with its SPA fallback (200 HTML), so the
local playground tried to "connect to a device", failed, and left a
stuck "device unreachable" banner. Fixed to require real device JSON.
Good catch — it would've bitten the normal local playground, not just
the test.

Queued your other note (extend builtins/features/language — the "not
limited to PB" thesis) as a design task for a docs/ideas.md brainstorm.

The device is back (you re-flashed it) and healthy; I've deliberately
kept my remote testing light after the earlier WiFi-wedge, and the
flash-vs-WiFi fix (task 16) is the thing that unlocks safe remote
iteration again.

## 2026-07-06 ~06:30 — full playground serves from flash (works!) + an OTA regression to fix, and I've STOPPED touching the device

Big win and an honest problem, both real.

**Works, browser-verified against the real PB:** the whole Svelte
playground now lives in the device's flash and serves from it. New
pieces: an "assets" flash partition (0x310000, 960 KB) behind the OTA
slots; a `LUXA` archive format (`web/tools/pack-assets.mjs` packs the
gzipped `dist/` — 279 KB, 4 files); `POST /api/assets` streams it in
(independent of firmware OTA, hot-reloads the TOC, no reboot); the
server serves `/`, `/luxel.wasm`, etc. from flash with
`Content-Encoding: gzip`, embedded minimal page demoted to `/min`; and
the playground auto-enters device mode when same-origin `/api/status`
answers. Chromium loaded `http://192.168.0.205/` end to end: editor up,
device badge, 300-px preview, ~100 fps. Bumped the connection pool to 3
(safe now the stack overflow is fixed) so the preview socket doesn't
starve page/asset loads.

**Two real bugs, same root cause — the ESP32 flash-vs-WiFi hazard:**
1. Serving a *large* asset (JS 190 KB, wasm 87 KB — multi-chunk) stalls:
   interleaving esp-storage flash reads with WiFi TCP writes starves the
   executor, so the second `write_all` never drains. Single-chunk files
   (html, css) serve fine. Tried 8 KiB chunks + `yield_now` between
   writes — not enough.
2. **OTA now trips a hardware watchdog** during the erase phase when
   assets are installed: the device resets (no panic — a watchdog, not a
   Rust panic) ~14 s in, connection reset. It **fails safe every time** —
   always reboots back into the working build — but it means I can no
   longer push updates remotely, and I can't fix a running firmware's OTA
   path *via* OTA (chicken/egg).

**Decision: I stopped experimenting on the device.** It's in a stable,
fully-working state (serves the page, WS, live-code, small assets — all
good). Continuing to hammer it risked leaving it wedged for you, and I
was starting to see transient wedges under my own back-to-back tests.
The right fix for BOTH bugs is the standard one: **memory-map the assets
flash region** and read via the cached data bus instead of esp-storage
flash-controller ops — no cache-off windows, no WiFi starvation. That's
a clean next-session task (needs a serial flash to land, since it
changes the running OTA path). The source for everything above is
committed and sound; only the runtime flash-timing needs that rework.

**To get back to a fully-updatable device:** one serial flash of a build
with the mmap fix. Until then the PB happily runs what's on it.

Everything else tonight (debugger fixes, autocomplete, bidirectional WS,
language docs) is landed, hardware-verified where relevant, and
independent of this.

## 2026-07-06 ~05:15 — WS verdict + bidirectional multiplexing live on hardware (8daf311)

After your last flash the fixed build held: five status hammers, zero
panics, heap 121 KB free. Then the A/B you asked for, on the real PB:

|            | HTTP polling | WS push |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| rate       | 10.0 fps     | 9.7 fps |
| gap p50    | 87 ms        | 96 ms   |
| gap p90    | 143 ms       | 130 ms  |
| gap p99    | **394 ms**   | **185 ms** |

Same average rate, but the tail — the visible stutter — is halved.
Combined with freeing a connection slot, WS stays.

Your bidirectional suggestion then proved *necessary*, not optional:
with the push socket pinning one of the chip's two connections, extra
HTTP callers starved (reproduced: "fetch failed" under mixed load). Now
one socket carries everything — pixel push down, API calls up
(`"<id> call\nbody"` → `{"id":…,"r":…}`), playground multiplexes
transparently with HTTP fallback. The native mirror was rewritten from
tiny_http to a hand-rolled std HTTP layer so its /ws loop is
structurally identical to the firmware's (single-threaded full-duplex).

Hardware-verified end-to-end: 6 live-code pushes + control sets +
pattern fetch over one socket while pixels streamed and a concurrent
plain-HTTP request succeeded; zero panics. 12/12 device e2e, 25/25
local e2e, all tests green. Serial flashing also hardened along the
way: `flash` now erases otadata (the image you flash is the image that
boots — the mismatch that caused the 4 AM round).

## 2026-07-06 ~02:20 — INCIDENT: device down after WS OTA (my fault); recovery staged

The WS-push build OTA'd fine but the device never came back. Doing the
arithmetic I should have done first: bumping the server pool to 3 tasks ×
~32 KB buffers on top of WiFi's ~90 KB almost certainly exhausted the
ESP32's 184 KB heap at boot → allocation panic → and esp-backtrace's
default behavior is to HALT, so one panic = a brick until someone touches
power. You were asleep, serial detached; nothing I can do remotely — the
one failure mode OTA can't recover, found the hard way.

**When you're up: power-cycle the PB once.** A persistent watcher pushes
the staged recovery build (pool back to 2, smaller buffers, and — the
real fix — panics now reboot after 3 s instead of halting forever)
automatically the moment the device answers. If a power cycle alone
doesn't bring it back (crash loop), it'll still recover: each loop
iteration reboots through a WiFi window. Absolute worst case:
`espflash erase-region 0xd000 0x2000` over serial clears otadata → boots
factory.

Meanwhile: docs/lang.md (full language reference) written; continuing
with hardware-independent work (bidirectional WS protocol + remote
debugger against the native mirror, const/let).

## 2026-07-06 ~01:45 — WS pixel push implemented, hardware A/B in progress

Implemented across all four surfaces (firmware /ws, native mirror,
playground, minimal page): binary frames = pixels ~15 Hz, text frames =
typed JSON (status+controls, vars/readouts). 12/12 device e2e green.

Per your note, measuring on the real PB before keeping it. Baseline
captured first, HTTP polling against the previous firmware:
**10.0 fps, gap p50 87 ms / p90 143 ms / p99 394 ms** — that jitter is
the choppiness you saw. WS build OTA'd (861 KB, no size tricks needed
now); push measurement running.

Your bidirectional-WS point is sound and the groundwork exists:
picoserve's next_frame takes a cancel signal that safely unblocks
between frames, so one socket can carry API calls + push concurrently.
If the numbers favor WS, I'll multiplex code/control/var (and later the
remote-debug protocol) onto the same connection.

## 2026-07-06 ~01:00 — editor autocomplete (140a8c6)

Typing pops completions for all 86 builtins with full signatures and
one-line docs (new `web/src/lib/builtins.ts`, kept in sync with the VM
table — it'll also seed the language reference). Predefined constants
(PI, pixelCount, GPIO modes…), keywords, and identifiers you've already
used in the pattern complete too. Verified in chromium; both e2e suites
still green.

Also queued your `const`/`let` language-extensions request as a task —
it needs compiler work (block scoping, assignment-to-const errors), so
it's sequenced after the device-facing items tonight.

## 2026-07-06 ~00:30 — debugger notes resolved (060884b)

**Your `heat` question: the debugger is right.** In Palette Fire 2D, `heat`
is assigned inside `render2D` *without* `var` — in PB's JS-derived scoping
(and ours), undeclared assignment creates a global. `var` inside a function
would make it local. Pinned with a test so it stays true.

**Breakpoint line mismatch: real bug, fixed.** Resolution only matched
exact lines, so a breakpoint on a blank/comment/brace line silently
installed *nothing* (and the dot pointed at a line that could never stop).
Now it snaps forward to the nearest executable line and the gutter dot
moves there — dot and stop-line always agree. While hunting this I
verified the rest of the chain is correct: pause happens *before* the
stopped line executes (so its variables show pre-execution values),
stepping tracks across beforeRender→render→pixels, and the paused line
scrolls into view.

Running log of autonomous work, newest first. Started the night of
2026-07-05 when Jeremy went to sleep ("keep going with less intervention").

## 2026-07-06 — overnight session begins

Queue for tonight, from Jeremy's list + existing plan, in intended order:

1. Debugger correctness pass: `heat`-as-global question + stopped-line
   highlight (his two debugger notes).
2. Editor autocomplete for builtins.
3. WebSocket pixel push (device + native mirror + playground + minimal page),
   then OTA to the PB and measure against HTTP polling.
4. NVS-stored WiFi credentials (kills the creds-baked-image lockout risk).
5. Pattern language docs.
6. Remote debugger design (+ implementation as far as the night allows).

Device state at session start: PB v3 at 192.168.0.205, slot ota_1, v0.1.1,
124 fps, rainbow restored after the live-code green test. OTA loop fully
proven (factory → ota_0 → ota_1 + bootloader-fallback test passed).
